## Introduction 

The **Computer Science Undergraduate Assistant (CSUA)** program aims to leverage the success
of undergraduates who have completed the course in which they serve and wish to share their 
knowledge and abilities with their peers. Participants provide valuable knowledge, insight, 
and learning strategies for both the students and the instructional team they work with, 
while also furthering their own mastery of related material. 

The CSUA program has two tracks:

1. **Peer Learning Assistant (PLA):** PLA Participants attend lectures and labs in participating
   active learning Computer Science courses to assist instructors in conducting active learning 
   exercises and answering student questions. Additionally, participants will hold office hours, 
   weekly review sessions, and aid in the creation of course content. Review sessions will be 
   entirely PLA-lead and cover material that the PLAs believe students are struggling with or 
   would benefit from additional reinforcement. PLAs may not grade.
   
1. **Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (UTA):** UTA participants work directly with the 
   instructional team, including Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs), to help with traditional 
   teaching assistant activities, including assignment assessment and office hours, as needed. 
   In particular, UTAs will regularly be challenged to reinforce their knowledge about course 
   material and ancillary concepts by grading assignments and helping create and test automated 
   evaluation tools for assignments. 
   
All participants must have taken the course they're assigned to at the University of Georgia and
received a satisfactory grade. As such, they will gain an invaluable alternative and applied 
perspective into the course to which they’re assigned. Compared to GTAs, undergraduate assistants
tend to have a closer peer relationship with other undergraduate students. As such, measures will 
be taken to directly address potential conflicts of interest, including, but not limited to, requiring 
the same conflict of interest training that is required for all UGA employees and anonymizing assignments 
so that they do not contain easily identifiable personal information. These practices have been 
approved for the CS department’s use of UTAs in the past.
